  - Once the start button is clicked, the grid loads ‚úÖ
    - and you see player 1's emoji whn you hover over a tile ‚úÖ
    - when player 1 clicks on a tile, their emoji is visible inside ‚úÖ
- Once it is player 2's turn, they can see their emoji when hovering over a tile üëà
    - on their turn, when player 2 clicks on a tile, their emoji is visible inside
  - The token I choose will be different from the one my opponent chooses
  - If it's my turn, I can use my emoji to mark a cell
  - If it's my opponents turn, they use their emoji to mark a cell
  - I can decide to change my emoji icon at any time
- I can restart the game at any time
- I can see the winning / losing / tied outcome of the game
- I am guided through the game with instructions ‚ùî

- I can choose to play against the computer
- I can choose to play against a friend!!!!!! (REACT or Node required?)
- I can choose to play the game with more cells (re factor game state into a constructor class or fn)

AADev,
